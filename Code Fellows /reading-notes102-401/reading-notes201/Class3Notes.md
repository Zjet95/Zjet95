# Learn HTML

## Ordered and Unordered lists.

* When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

*Unordered list are primarily used when ordering things that dont neccesarily need to be listed in numerical order, For ex. A shopping list usually can be represented as an unordered list.*
* How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

> list-style-type: disc|circle|square|decimal|lower-roman|upper-roman|
lower-greek|lower-latin|upper-latin|lower-alpha|upper-alpha|none|
inherit;
* When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

*Ordered list are primarily used when you need to order things in numerical order from*

* Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?



# Learn CSS
## The Box Model.

* Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

 1. Margin is the space outside of the border of an element it is also known as the space between elements,*

2. *padding is the space between your content box and your border*

* List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

1. Border - *CSS border properties are use to specify the style, color and size of the border of an element.*
2. Padding - *space between your content box and border*
3. Margin - *A margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.*
4. Width & Height - **
# Learn JS

## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

* What data types can you store inside of an Array?

 1. numbers 
 2. strings 
 3. boolean values (true and false), 
 4. characters 
 5. objects 

* Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

 > const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

 *This is not a valid array due to the numbers assigned to each string are assigned incorrectly *

* List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

1. *Ternary Operator*
**This is a great code saver when you want to write if..else statements
2. *Declaring Variables Shorthand*

** its good practice to declare your variable assignments at the beginning of your functions. This shorthand method can save you lots of time and space when declaring multiple variables at the same time. **
3. *JavaScript For Loop Shorthand*

** really useful if you want plain JavaScript and don’t want to rely on external libraries such as jQuery or lodash. **


4. *Short Circuit Evaluation*
** When assigning a variable value to another variable, you may want to ensure that the source variable is not null, undefined, or empty. You can either write a long if statement with multiple conditionals, or use a short-circuit evaluation. **
5. *Decimal Base Exponents*

** essentially a fancy way to write numbers without the trailing zeros.**



* Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 > let a = 10;
 > let b = 'dog';
 > let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

* Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

*conditional statments are useful when you have mulitiple choices and each one requires a good amount of code to be ran.

* Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

*Loops are best for when you wish to repeat a block of code.*

## Thing I want to learn more about...

1. I wish to just keep practicing with javascript until I have a firm understanding of the basics.
