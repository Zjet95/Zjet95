# Chart.js, Canvas

## JavaScript Canvas

**What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?**

It allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript

**What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?**

Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the `<canvas>` element. 

**Explain what the getContext() method does.**

It returns a render context object.

## Chart.js Documentation

**What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?**

It is a charting library that provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options.

**List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.**

1. Radar chart - A radar chart is a way of showing multiple data points and the variation between them. They are often useful for comparing the points of two or more different data sets.

2. Line chart - A line chart is a way of plotting data points on a line. Often, it is used to show trend data, or the comparison of two data sets.

3. Doughnut and Pie chart - Pie and doughnut charts are probably the most commonly used charts. They are divided into segments, the arc of each segment shows the proportional value of each piece of data. They are excellent at showing the relational proportions between data.

## Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

**What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?**

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

**How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**

It could improve our current project by showing a chart of the number of views and votes for each picture.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to implement charts in our current webspage as I think it would look visually appealing.
