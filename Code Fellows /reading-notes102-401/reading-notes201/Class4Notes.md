## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Postioning

1. *What is meant by "normal flow"?*

* Normal flow is the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their specific layout.

2. *What are a few differneces between block-level and inline elements?*

* Block level elements take up the entire width of a webpage that is available while inline elements stack next to each other without taking the entire width of the webpage. However this can be manipulated with CSS to make one appear as the other.

3. *__ postioning is the default for every html element.*

* Static is the default postioning for HTML elements. Static postioned elements are not affected by the top right bottom or left properties as all of these are default to static.

4. *Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element*

* Very good cross-browser support 
* Allows you to place elements exactly where you want by using bottom, top, right, left
* And it allows elements to be postioned independently of thier parent elements.
