# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

**Explain why we need domain modeling.**

Domain Modeling creates a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. If this is done well a programmer can verify and validate the understanding of the problem with others.

## HTML Table Basics

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

1. Layout tables make reading the webpage less accessible for visually impaired users

2. The code is harder to write and read than just using proper layout techniques

3. They are not automatically responsive. They are sized by their content default so extra measures are needed to get the layout to work correctly.

**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML** `<table>`.

1. `<th>` - Adds a header to your table

2. `<td>` - Table data element that puts data inside the cells of a table

3. `<tr>` - Table row element used to create new rows.

## Introducing Constructors

**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**

A constructor is a function that is called by using the `new` keyword. It is a way to reuse code and create a new object.

**How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**

When using an object literal `this` refers to the current object the code is being written inside. However, `this` used in a constructor will apply to every object the constructor creates.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

**Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**
**NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question**

An analogy for prototypes in tthe real world  would be learning a new skill set at job from a coworker.  The coworker has the knowledge of a particular task but without communicating with him/her you will not be able to perform the task at hand. Therefore the coworker passes his knowledge to you so you can know how to do it as well.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to understand prototypes better through coding/practice.
