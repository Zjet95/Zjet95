## JavaScript Object Basics

1. *How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?* 

In JavaScript, an object is a sole entity that consist of properties and a type. You can compare it to a real world scenario this way, you have a a cup,  a cup is an object and the cup also consist of addtional properties as it has a specifc color, design, weight and material.

2. *What are some advantages to creating object literals?

* They give flexibilty in declartion

* You can drop an object literal anywhere in your program with no previous setup and it'll work.

3. *How do objects differ from arrays?*

* Objects represent "things" with specific characteristics aka properties, arrays store list of data into a single variable so that you are able to invoke that variable and call upon the things stored into that list later on based on their specific index.

4. *Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.*  

* Bracket Notation is used when you need to access specific properties with special characters in their names. bracket notation must be used whenever you are attempt to access an objects property using a variable.

5. *Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?*

* The 'This' Function allows us to Reuse functions in different execution context, The advantage of this is that once defined it can be invoked for different objects using this keyword.

## Introduction To The DOM

1. *What is the DOM?*

* The DOM stands for Document Object Model and it allows JavaScript to access and change all the elements of an HTML document. 

* DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

1. Core DOM - standard model for all document types
2. XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
3. HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

* The HTML DOM defines;

- The HTML elements as **objects**
- The **properties** of all HTML elements
- The **methods** to access all HTML elements
- The **events** for all HTML elements




2. *Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript?*

The DOM simply allows Javascript to interact with its elements to in turn manipulate them to do many different things with JavaScript.
