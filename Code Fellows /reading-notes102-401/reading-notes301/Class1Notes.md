# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a “component”?**

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.


**What are the characteristics of a component?**

- **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- **Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

Ease of deployment, Reduced Cost, Ease of development, Reuseable, Modificatioon of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independence.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is “props” short for?**

Properties

**How are props used in React?**

1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data


**What is the flow of props?**

In a uni-directional flow
